## Methodology  
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded the COVID and happiness datasets.  
   - Reshaped COVID datasets from wide (dates as columns) to long format.  
   - Aggregated data to get per-country totals for confirmed cases and deaths.  
   - Merged datasets with happiness indicators.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Time-series analysis of confirmed cases and deaths.  
   - Top countries by total cases and deaths.  
   - Happiness indicator distributions.  

3. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Examined whether higher happiness scores (and related indicators like GDP, social support, and life expectancy) correlate with COVID outcomes.  
   - Computed correlation coefficients and visualized with scatter plots and heatmaps.  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Line charts of global and country-specific trends.  
   - Bar charts of top impacted countries.  
   - Correlation heatmaps between COVID outcomes and happiness metrics.  

## Key Findings  
- Countries with higher GDP per capita tended to report more confirmed cases, possibly reflecting better testing and reporting.  
- Happiness indicators like social support and life expectancy showed mild correlation with lower COVID fatality rates.  
- No strong evidence that overall happiness directly reduced COVID spread, but some indicators were linked with resilience.
